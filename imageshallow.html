  <p>Something that I really liked about this picture is the focus on the camera. I am glad I was able to take a picture like this because I have never used a camera before. I like the blurred yellow tinted background. Getting the camera to focus on one thing was hard because instead on focusing on one thing, it kept focusing on everything which is not what I wanted.</p>
