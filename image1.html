  <p>The reason I chose this image is because I really liked how the fire hose sign stood out, it was very bright compared to its dull surroundings. As I was editing my picture I was hoping to emphasize the yellowish tone it has while also keeping the fire hose sign nice and bright. I feel like I did okay in making the sign stay bright, it's still bright but you can see that I used the red in curves to make it stand out more since there is a bright red halo around it. I did well in making my picture more bright while still keeping that dull feeling. </p>
