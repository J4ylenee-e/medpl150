  <p>For my first photomontage, which is the one that contains blue jays, I decided to create something that looks like a steampunk clock, they are the clocks that show its mechanism. I tried to use the oval shape to make it look like the small components inside a clock and made the stroke dashed to give it that rotating illusion. I added them all around that photomontage to indicate that time is ticking, that we should step up and do more to protect these birds and the rainbow mountain that has tourists every year. For the second photomontage I decided to create a tomb using the pen tool which was a little difficult to do since I wanted both sides to be proportionate but one side would be more inwards and the other more outwards. I think in the end I managed to make it pretty symmetrical thanks to the grid. I also used a text tool to add in the words RIP and filled in the tomb with a gray color. I decided to put the tomb design on top of the Statue of Liberty as to indicate that the killing of pigeons kind of removes the thing New York City is known for which is pigeons, it's like removing a symbol of the city. The Statue of Liberty is what people usually think of when they hear New York City which is why I put it on the top of the thing that represents New York, kind of to symbolize the death of something else that represents New York, the pigeons. </p>
