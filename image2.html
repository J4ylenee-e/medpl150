  <img src="images/image_b.jpg" alt="image b" width="600">
  <p>The reason I chose this image is because I felt like it looked best when cropped to be (5”x7”) also because I liked the lights that stand out on top of the left shelf. I like how claustrophobic it looks thanks to the crop. To edit this picture I was trying to go in the same direction as I did in image A but instead I decided to make it look like something that looks like it would be posted in tumblr back then. The emphasis on the yellow tint is something I really like, which I did using the blue curve and lowering it.</p>
