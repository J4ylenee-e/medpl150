  <p>Reading this made me think of many times in which I have asked myself is this AI? I usually spend a good amount of time scrolling through social media and now I am noticing a lot of AI videos appearing. These AI videos range from things that look simple such as asmr, but then some of these AI videos are of politicians saying things that people would find humorous, but that just desensitizes people and makes them think that the problems happening around us aren’t as bad as people make them seem. These AI videos are also sometimes really hard to spot so people are bound to fall for it and believe whatever is happening in these videos. Not only does it trick people, AI is also stealing work from real artists, people now don’t find it necessary to hire someone to do art for them since AI is available everywhere and is considered cheaper, but this is just art being made from an AI that was taught to imitate art from actual artists. The worst part is that some of these AI art imitate real art so well to the point people can’t even see its AI, so someone can be casually scrolling and liking art that is AI generated without knowing. Now ChatGPT has become a big problem throughout the world, not only is it harmful to the environment, but now it's making people rely on it making them no longer find it necessary to learn a material themselves. They can ask anything they want in ChatGPT and they will be given an answer in which they can easily copy and get away with, even for the most simple tasks people start asking questions. ChatGPT isn't even completely accurate, but people don’t know that because they are made to think that a bot can never make mistakes. I’ve even heard people say around me that ChatGPT is making people dumber because they are forgetting the most simple things. AI just keeps improving as the years go by, before it was easy to recognize that something was AI generated, but now it looks so accurate and can imitate almost anything really well. AI has become so normalized that people don’t even take the time to educate themselves on how harmful AI can be, of course there are instances in which AI can be interesting and useful but it shouldn’t be used the way it’s being used now. Even now AI is being used to do trends on TikTok and there are many people who do these trends because they go viral, there is even people who use AI to make instagram accounts for people that look real but they aren’t people they are just AI generated people doing things that actual people do in their posts which is so scary. AI isn’t something completely accurate, it’s programmed to know a lot of things but the information it's being taught sometimes can be racist, homophobic, and a lot of more negative things so it sometimes gives these types of responses to people.
