  <p>Taking the pictures for this assignment was a bit confusing, but I feel like in the end I was proud of the pictures I took. Prior to this class I had never used a professional camera but luckily the pictures/explanations on each function of a camera helped me. While taking my pictures I was going for darker images and that it would look kind of mysterious so that's why most of my pictures look sort of gloomy. Using photoshop looked like it was going to be a big challenge, but the linkedin learning videos really did help a lot. I also never used photoshop so opening the app was a big surprise, there were so many options and I'm excited to play around with every function in there. As I was editing my pictures I wasnâ€™t really sure on how I wanted them to look like, so I just did what felt/looked right to me. I had fun using curves, I would play around with it until I found something I liked. Next time instead of just playing around with the adjustment layers, I would like to better understand what each does, even though it was explained in the linkedin learning videos, I am still confused on what exactly each does, also I noticed that my picture became more blurry when I cropped/edited my pictures, so this is a problem I would like to fix.
