  <p>To capture images and create graphics means to see parts of the world, whether it's bad or good, and share with the world that point of view. Capturing images is about sharing them and giving them meaning. Not everyone will view the image the same way, but everyone is able to at least think of something when they see any kind of image. I think that's the beauty of capturing images and creating graphics, you can capture literally anything and give it meaning. You show people things they usually overlook and I think that's beautiful. It's something that can be preserved for many years, and they all hold a message/memory.<br>

Photographers specifically choose to take a picture at a particular moment and then with the help of editing apps edit these pictures to give statements, even sometimes the original picture itself is enough to show the realities of the world. Pictures are on everything we consume, on social media, on newspapers, in advertisements we see outside, and literally everywhere. This is what we see everyday so it's no surprise that the way we see the world is thanks to the pictures we see everyday. This can also be a dangerous thing because photographs can be mistaken as truths, as the text said “photographs furnish evidence” so people are bound to believe what they see, but these pictures can be selected and manipulated to make people believe things. Also now with how social media has become popular, people have the urge to document everything in their lives not only to keep as memory but to also prove things to others. This is influencing our behaviors and experiences because now it's like people only take pictures to show something that isn't completely authentic and mostly everything is performative.<br>

To represent today's moment through photography, illustration, or image+text I would like to show a picture of everyone on their phones, whether it in a public space or even a family dinner to show how everyone is always on their phone nowadays, but the big problem being that even though we have electronics, not everyone is aware of the problems happening around them. It's like a contradiction, people live on their phones and spend so much time on social media and yet don't really know about the things happening around even though social media is known to be a popular place to share today's news. I would like to be able to show that the problem you think you're facing can be a problem that people all over the world are going through. It's important to know what's happening around you and why, this is why photographs being posted in social media are super important, but it's also important to know the history of things since images can be edited to invoke specific feelings which people who don't know the history of can be easily persuaded to believe. It's important to capture not only what people see everyday but also what's overlooked, what's exactly behind the problems of today's moment.
