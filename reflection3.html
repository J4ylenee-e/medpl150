<p>As I was using photoshop, I realized that I prefer in-camera photo editing, instead of Photoshop DoF because it just looks way more natural. Starting off with the blur filter, doing this on photoshop was way more harder than figuring this on in the camera. The camera was also way more fun to use than actually editing a picture on photoshop. </p>
